## A simple protocol for Vectorized Affinity

## Operation

To run this thing you need a .env text file at the ROOT of the project
which contains just one line:

`VITE_OAIKEY=MyKeyHere`

were MyKeyHere is your OpenAI access token.

From there just run

`npm i`

to install dependencies and then run

`npm run dev`

to start your local server. This will bring up the little web component test framework and you can generate some vectors dude!
